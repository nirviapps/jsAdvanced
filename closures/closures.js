Lexical Scope 
-> Itâ€™s an environment where we write something and generally lexical refers to compile time,example where we write particular function 
-> When we define one function inside another function, the second function is lexically inside the first function 



closures -> A closure is a function tha references varibales in the outer scope from it's inner scope
